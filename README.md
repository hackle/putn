# Pragmatic Unit Testing Now!

The sample project for the workshop in C# / .NET Core.

TL;DR if you can run `dotnet test` and see tests pass then chances are you are all set.

Be warned: this page changes from time to time and workshop to workshop (possibly just very slightly and the gist should stay the same).

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core
- Git
- and IDE to work with, e.g. Visual Studio Code

Overall, just make sure you can run `dotnet build` / `dotnet test` on this project.

## The example explained

## the goal of the workshop

* halve the code for this project
* happily write simple code and simple unit tests, and benefit now! Not later.
* and then a great reveal!
